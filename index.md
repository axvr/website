I'm a software engineer attempting to discover how to create better computer
and software systems.  Here you will find things related to the following
topics:

- the design/creation of safe, secure, effective and simple software systems;
- experimentation and expression using computers (e.g. programming languages);
- the history of computers and computer science; and
- generally having fun with computation.

## Favourites

- [Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6365078/library_of_axvr/library): Recommended reading and watching.
- [Ascribe](/projects/ascribe): A simpler alternative to EditorConfig.

## Find/contact me

- Email: insert an `@` between my first and surname, then append `.uk`.
- Code: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/axvr), [GitHub](https://github.com/axvr).
