Ascribe is a standard for software development tools (specifically editors) to
retrieve and handle useful information about various files within a project
through the `.gitattributes` file already found in many software projects.

By using the `.gitattributes` file, Ascribe keeps all information about the
files in a project in a single place. Ascribe extensions tend to be much
smaller, faster and simpler than their
[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) counterparts.
